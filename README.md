Project Title: Swiggy Real-Time Data Analysis Dashboard
Project Description
This project demonstrates a real-time data analysis pipeline for Swiggy food delivery data. It includes a Python script to simulate incoming orders, a Power BI dashboard for visualizing key metrics, and the raw data used for the analysis. The goal is to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and analyzing food delivery operations, including sales, delivery times, and customer ratings.

Key Components
order_generator.py: A Python script that simulates real-time food delivery orders and appends them to an Excel file. This script generates data points such as order_id, restaurant, location, price, delivery_time, and rating.

orders.xlsx: The Excel file where the simulated real-time order data is stored.

swiggy dashboard.pbix: A Power BI dashboard file that connects to the orders.xlsx data source. This dashboard is designed to provide dynamic visualizations of key performance indicators (KPIs).

How to Use
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

pandas

openpyxl

Power BI Desktop

Setup and Execution
Clone the Repository: Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

Run the Data Generator: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the Python script to start generating data.

python order_generator.py
This will continuously add new order data to the orders.xlsx file. Keep this script running to simulate real-time data flow.

Open the Dashboard: Open the swiggy dashboard.pbix file using Power BI Desktop. Power BI will automatically connect to the orders.xlsx file. You may need to refresh the data within Power BI to see the latest orders generated by the Python script.
